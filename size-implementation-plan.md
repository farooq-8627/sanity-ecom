# Size Implementation Plan for E-Commerce Platform

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for adding size handling capabilities to our e-commerce platform. The feature will allow products to have multiple sizes, track inventory by size, and ensure orders capture size information.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Schema Updates

#### 1.1 Product Schema
- Add `hasSizes` boolean flag to indicate if a product has size options
- Add `sizes` array with `ProductSize` interface (size name, enabled status)
- Make stock field conditional based on hasSizes flag

#### 1.2 Order Schema
- Update order line items to include size information
- Ensure size is captured during checkout process

### 2. Store Implementation (Zustand)

#### 2.1 Update CartItem Interface
```typescript
export interface CartItem {
  product: Product;
  quantity: number;
  size?: string; // Optional size field
}
```

#### 2.2 Update Store Methods
- Modify `addItem` to accept size parameter
- Modify `removeItem` to consider size when removing items
- Update `getItemCount` to consider size when counting items
- Ensure all cart operations respect size differences

### 3. UI Components

#### 3.1 ProductInteractiveSection Component
- Add size selection UI with available sizes from product data
- Disable unavailable sizes
- Show appropriate status messages based on selection

#### 3.2 QuantityButtons Component
- Update to handle size-specific quantities
- Ensure stock limits are respected per size

#### 3.3 AddToCartButton Component
- Require size selection when product has sizes
- Show appropriate validation messages

### 4. Order Processing

#### 4.1 Cart Display
- Show selected size in cart items
- Allow changing sizes if needed

#### 4.2 Checkout Process
- Ensure size information is included in order creation
- Validate stock availability by size during checkout

#### 4.3 Order Management
- Display size information in order details
- Include size in packing/shipping information

## Implementation Approach
1. Start with type definitions and schema updates
2. Update store logic to handle sizes
3. Modify UI components to support size selection
4. Test the complete flow from product viewing to order completion
5. Ensure backward compatibility with existing products

## Technical Considerations
- Use TypeScript interfaces to ensure type safety
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing products
- Ensure proper validation at all steps
- Handle edge cases (e.g., out of stock sizes, removing items by size)
